# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

This Code Refactoring was done to change the syntax off both the CSS and HTML for 2 main reasons. 

For the HTML it was done mostly to make it more accesible for vissually impared people. For the CSS it was to make the code reflective of the changes made in HTML and to simplify it. 

Thank you
